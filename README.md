# Octagon Poker

Poker tracker for a group of friends including charts for net earnings, session trackers, and individual player stats. 

## Getting Started
1. Delete the mydb.sqlite file. The database will try to initialize on every reload (need to fix this)
2. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Work in progress, but basic features are almost completed.
